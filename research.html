              <p align="justify">Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model
building among a large number of participants without the
need for explicit data sharing. But this approach shows vulnerabilities when gradient inversion attacks are applied to
it. FL models are at higher risk in the event of a gradient
inversion attacks, which has a higher success rate in retrieving sensitive data from the model gradients, due to the
presence of communication in their inherent architecture.
The most alarming thing about this gradient inversion attack is that it can be performed in such a covert way that it
does not hamper the training performance while the attackers backtrack from the gradients to get information about
the raw data. Some of the common existing approaches
proposed to prevent data reconstruction in the context of
FL are adding noise with differential privacy, homomorphic
encryption, and gradient pruning. These approaches suffer
from some major drawbacks, including a tedious key generation process during encryption with an increasing number
of clients, a significant performance drop, and difficulty in
selecting a suitable pruning ratio. As a countermeasure,
we propose a mixed quantization enabled FL scheme, and
we empirically show that issues addressed above can be
resolved. In addition, our approach can ensure more robustness as different layers of the deep model are quantized
with different precisions and quantization modes. We empirically proved the validity of our defense method against
both the iteration based and recursion based gradient inversion attacks and evaluated the performance of our proposed
FL framework on three benchmark datasets and found out
that our approach outperformed the baseline defense mechanisms </p>

              <h4><a href="DSDV-details.html">Gradient Inversion Attacks on Acoustic Signals: Revealing Security Risks in Audio Recognition Systems</a></h4>
              <p align="justify"> With a greater emphasis on data confidentiality and legislation, distributed training and collaborative machine learning algorithms are being developed to protect sensitive private data. Gradient exchange has become a widely used practice in those multi-node machine learning systems. But with the advent of gradient inversion attacks, it is already established that private training data can be revealed from the gradients. Gradient inversion attacks covertly spy on gradient updates and backtrack from the gradients to obtain information about the raw data. Although this attack has been widely studied in computer vision and natural language processing tasks, understanding the impact of this attack on acoustic signals still requires a comprehensive investigation. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore gradient inversion attacks on acoustic signals by extracting the speakersâ€™ voices from an audio recognition system. Here, we design a new application of gradient inversion attack to retrieve the audio signal used for training the deep learning model, irrespective of whether the audio has undergone conversion into mel-spectrogram or MFCC representations prior to feed to neural network. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of our attack method to extract the input vectors of the audio data from the gradients, which highlight the security risks in revealing the sensitive audio data from highly secured systems. We also discuss several possible strategies as countermeasures and their effectiveness to prevent the attack. </p>

               <h4><a href="DSDV-details.html">Towards developing a data security aware federated training framework in multi-modal contested environments</a></h4>
              <p align="justify"> Secure data communication is crucial in contested environments such as battlefields. In such environments, there is always risk of data breach through unauthorized interceptions. This may lead to unauthorized access to tactical information and infiltration into the systems. In this work, we propose a detailed training setup in the federated learning framework for object classification where the raw data will be maintained locally at the edge devices and will not be shared with a central server or with each other. The server sends a global model to edge devices, which is then trained locally at the edge, and the updated parameters are sent back to the central server, where they are aggregated, which takes place iteratively. This setup ensures robustness against malicious cyberattacks as well as reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, to tackle the irregularity in object classification task with a single data modality in such contested environment, a deep learning model incorporating multiple modalities is used as the global model in our proposed federated learning setup. This model can serve as a possible solution in object identification with multi-modal data. We conduct a comprehensive analysis on the importance of multi-modal approach compared to individual modalities within our proposed federate learning setup. We also provide a resource profiling based on memory requirements, training time, and energy usage on two resource constrained devices to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. </p>
